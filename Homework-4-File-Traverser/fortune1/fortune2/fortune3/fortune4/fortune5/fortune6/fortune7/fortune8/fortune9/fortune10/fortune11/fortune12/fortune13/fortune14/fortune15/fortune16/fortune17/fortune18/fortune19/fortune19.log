Tech Support: &quot;You're having a problem with getting your mail?&quot; 
  Customer: &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  Tech Support: &quot;Ok, tell me line by line everything you do.&quot; 
  Customer: &quot;I click 'check mail' and it asks me for my password.&quot; 
  Tech Support: &quot;Ok, so you type your password.&quot; 
  Customer: &quot;No, I already did when I logged on, so I click 'Cancel'.&quot; 
  Tech Support: &quot;No, Ma'am, you have to type your password.&quot; 
  Customer: [pause] &quot;Hey, what do you know, I got some mail!&quot;
