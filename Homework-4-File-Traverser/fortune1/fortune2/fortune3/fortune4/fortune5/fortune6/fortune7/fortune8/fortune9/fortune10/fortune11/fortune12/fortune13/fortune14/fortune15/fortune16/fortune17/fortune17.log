When &quot;Yankee Doodle stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni,&quot; it wasn't a reference to food. It referred to the Macaroni Club, founded in the mid-18th century, made up of English &quot;dandies&quot; who took on foreign mannerisms and fashions. The song was originally intended to ridicule the American revolutionary troops, but was eventually taken over by them as a marching song.
