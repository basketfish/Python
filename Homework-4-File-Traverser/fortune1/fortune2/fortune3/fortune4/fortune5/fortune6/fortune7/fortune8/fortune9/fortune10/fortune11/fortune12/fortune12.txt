Sail on silvergirl, 
Sail on by. 
Your time has come to shine. 
All your dreams are on their way. 
See how they shine. 
If you need a friend 
I'm sailing right behind. 
Like a bridge over troubled water 
I will ease your mind. 
Like a bridge over troubled water 
I will ease your mind.

- as sung by Simon &amp; Garfunkel &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;
