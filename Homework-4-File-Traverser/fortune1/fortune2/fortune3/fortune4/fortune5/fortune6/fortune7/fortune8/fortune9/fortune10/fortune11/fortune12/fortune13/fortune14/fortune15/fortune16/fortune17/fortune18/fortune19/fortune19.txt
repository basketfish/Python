My father works for a multinational company and he is the manager of a project 
that implements a new sales support system in the entire region he is operating 
in. The program itself is a distributed database, allowing individual users to 
make their own updates on their laptop PCs and then uploading their changes to a 
server as well as downloading all the changes the other users have made. When he 
wrote the instructions to the sales representatives on how to do this he got the 
letter back from one of the regional offices with complaints. His original 
instructions read like this:
  From the File menu, select OS-Shell. This will make your screen look like 
  this: C:\SPS\WIN
  Now type DOWNLOAD to..., blah, blah, blah, etc, etc. 
The hand-written remark on the sheet of paper was, &quot;These instructions are 
incorrect and cannot be followed! Right after C:\SPS\WIN, a strange bracket (&gt;) 
pops up and it will not go away!&quot;
