&lt;jkauffman&gt;  Lynx_: you do seem to do a lot of climbing
 &lt;jkauffman&gt;  Lynx_: you'll have the last laugh when the apocalypse
              comes
 &lt;jkauffman&gt;  you'll be physically fit
 &lt;jkauffman&gt;  climbing over the mountains of sulfurous ash
 &lt;jkauffman&gt;  bounding over rivers of lava
     &lt;Lynx_&gt;  sounds great
     &lt;Lynx_&gt;  but what will i eat?
 &lt;jkauffman&gt;  those who didn't bother to practice climbing
     &lt;Lynx_&gt;  eww
     &lt;Lynx_&gt;  those will be all fatty
     &lt;Lynx_&gt;  but maybe sulfurous ash is not so bad with some salt
 &lt;jkauffman&gt;  perhaps
